# PrivacyMatters - WWDC24 Swift Student Challenge [Accepted - Distinguished Winner]

## Summary

PrivacyMatters is an app that explains the most important and interesting concepts of privacy in an innovative, interactive, and fun way.

## Motivation

Last year, I heard a lecture about privacy. I was amazed that almost every American can be identified by only their ZIP, date of birth, and gender. I felt like that often, people are not aware of the effects even small amounts of data can have. 

Therefore, I decided to create PrivacyMatters, an app that teaches about the most interesting aspects of privacy to spread awareness. PrivacyMatters consists of multiple lessons, which can be selected on the left sidebar. Then, the user can study about a privacy-related topic in the middle of the app.

Because plain learning isn't fun and not very interactive, there is a short quiz for every lesson on the right side. For example, users need to log into a (simulated) bank account using information from a data breach, match browser requests, or find out about a person’s disease. After the final quiz, a special award is given, which can also be shared.

PrivacyMatters is written in my favorite framework SwiftUI. It also uses AVFoundation for playing sounds, and UserDefaults for storing progress. Media was taken from notificationsounds.com or Pixabay (Creative Commons). The app icon was made with Pixelmator Pro. 

PS: Also check out dark mode :)

## How to run

The app runs best with an 11 or 12.9-inch iPad Pro (real device or simulator). 

However, any other device should work fine as well.
