    TextContent(text: "Often, people argue that they don't care about privacy because they have \"nothing to hide\". However, privacy has larger impacts on people's lives than one might think."),
    
    TextContent(title: "Security", text: "Privacy and security go hand in hand. With possibly hundreds of organizations having access to your data, data breaches get more and more likely. The possibilities of abusing datasets are practically endless. Dropped credit scores, bank account robbery, or spoofed messages, just to name a few."),

    TextContent(title: "Souvereignty", text: "In addition, privacy directly correlates with the sovereignty of a person. If it is not guaranteed that the data of a person is protected, people will act differently.
